for each new implementation we need to add a new comparison  
and change the if statement to get the expected result as 
we can see in the version 1

To improve the implementation we can create an interface 
for which type of parameter we can compare and another 
interface to implement the filter which receives the interface 
specification and with these interfaces it is possible to create a new 
class that implements filter with the Class implementation which is in this
example Product, then overrides the filter interface for this type 
And after we can create a specifications for color and size parameters 
which holds the responsability to return if the item attributes match
And for compare both attributes we can a template specialization 
to return its result if is a color or a size
